<h1> Learn some facts about my school</h1>

<p>
Here are some facts about my university. I go to Rutgers, but more specifically the Newark campus. It is located in Newark, NJ at 195 University Ave, Newark, NJ 07102. I go to the school of arts and sciences here at Rutgers. I am currently studying Computer Science as my major but I am also doing a Data Science minor. Some courses I'm taking this semester are calc 3, intensive programming, operating systems, and advanced data structures.
